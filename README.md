### Hi there, I'm Andrei 👋

I'm a **software developer and teacher from Romania** with a passion for building things from scratch, solving real problems, and helping others grow — whether that's through code or coaching.

I started with landing pages, then leveled up into fullstack projects, exploring everything from **.NET Core**, **React**, and **Django** to **RabbitMQ** and **Mantine UI**. At one point, I thought I'd work solo forever — until I got hit by this quote:

> 💡 *“Working alone gets you there faster. Working in a team gets you further.”*
